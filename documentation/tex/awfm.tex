\chapter{Using the Graphical Interface}

\section{Creating a New Model}

\section{Units}

The units dialog is used for specifying three unit types in the model:
length, time, and discharge. The discharge unit applies to pumping rates
\footnote{In reality, discharge may be expressed in units of length and time. 
Here, discharge units are specified separately to allow plotting in units familiar to the user.},
while length and time units apply to everything else.

\section{Data Importing}

\subsection{CSV}

\subsection{Excel}

\subsection{SQLite}

\section{Timeseries Processing}

The timeseries dialog, which is used for importing and viewing
pumping rates and observed water levels, has a handful of useful 
functions detailed below.

\subsection{Scale}

\emph{Scale} here is used in the mathematical sense of multiplying
a value by a scalar. This function is most useful for converting 
between units, but could also be used to model what-if scenarious. 
For example, it is possible to see the effect of increasing or 
decreasing discharge volumes by a percent.

\subsection{Translate}

\emph{Tranlation} is also used in the mathematical sense of adding
some scalar to a value. This function is useful if observed water
levels at multiple wells were all taken relative to their own piezometer
elevations and need to be converted to a consistent elevation.

Another application of the translation function is to adjust $t_0$.
Data imported from Excel may have a $t_0$ in the early 1900s, whereas
it may be more useful to have a $t_0$ when production began at the wellfield.

\subsection{Erroneous/Missing Data}

The data import utility will set missing row values to -9999. These need
to be dealt with before the forward model can produce meaningful results.

One option is to simply remove missing data. In the context of pumping
rates, this means that the value at the missing data point is effectively
equal to the value at the previously measured data point:

<insert table>

Another option is to perform a linear interpolation through the missing
data point, which may be desirable for approximating missing water levels.

\subsection{Project Onto Line}

This operation performs a piece-wise linear interpolation, which is
useful for data reduction or simply for obtaining a data set with a 
constant time step for input into a numerical model.

\subsection{Range Constraints}

\subsection{Data Reduction}
